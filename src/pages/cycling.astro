    <h2>The Pioneer Valley</h2>
    <p>
      I go to UMass Amherst so a big portion of my cycling has been around the
      Pioneer Valley. One of my side goals was to visit all the towns which
      border the Connecticut River, and I accomplished this goal on April 20th,
      2024.

    <h2> The North Shore and Friends </h2>
    <p>
      After doing Cycling to the Holyoke Mall, I was excited for the Summer and
      all the new things I had yet to see. I couldn't contain the glee I had to
      explore a bunch of new places and see a bunch of new things. During that
      Summer I visited a lot places and got to see my favorite Massachussets
      town for the first time, Gloucester.
