        <h2> Monopoly Datasite</h2>
        <h4> Motivation </h4>
        <p>
          One of the things I always hated was never finishing a Monopoly Game,
          and I never really found a good website for storing these games so I
          decided to make my own.
        </p>
        <h4> Technology Journey </h4>
        <p>
          I always wanted to try out a fullstack project. I came in with the belief
          that it would not be that hard because there are tons of people out there
          that try to make the job easy for you. As I result, I jumped into the project
          with PEVN Stack (Postgres, Express, Vue, Node). I wanted the project to be simple
          where I would have data defined in postgres and it would allow you to visualize
          all the spots. Once I completed the task I thought that this was unambitious
          and thought I could utilize more aspects of fullstack beyond simple GET requests.
          So, I decided to add the storage UI for storing the states, authentication, and a
          profiles page to view your games. Somewhere along the road when I was updating I ran
          into issues between Vite and Express. Feeling that this was a sign that this was the
          wrong approach I decided to embrace Nuxt. So over time I rewrote the project to use Nuxt.
          I eventually was able to implement all of the features with everything working locally,
          so I go to deploy this project to Vercel. I notice that my deployment is failing, due to
          Prisma, so I used this as a chance to try something new. While Prisma is a fine ORM,
          the additional latency that the ORM's architecture adds to queries was not something that
          I liked. Additionally, I didn't like how abstracted Prisma felt from SQL. Then I tried
          Drizzle ORM. it was a pain getting all the queries migrated to Prisma, and tearing out
          all the queries I did in a day, but it was worth it. With Drizzle, I was able to
          deploy my website and have other people visit it which is pretty nice.
        </p>
        <h4> Reflections </h4>
        <p>
          While I was very impatient with my willingness to stick to technologies, the real value
          I got out of this project is beginning to figure out what technologies I like to use.
          For instance, I don't like express. While I did not run into any of the scalability issues
          that express has, I don't feel like it was the best framework to solve my problem.
          Although nuxt and the utilities it provided (thank unJS) were nice, upon reflection,
          leads me to feel like the overall concept of the website I had was over-engineered. I believe
          the optimal way for me to make this website would have been a SPA (Single Page Application)
          leveraging native browser APIs to solve the users needs.

        <h2> Currency-X-Change </h2>
        <h4> Motivation </h4>
        <p>
          I as a person like collaborating working with my friends, and this extends to coding.
          I collaborated with my friend Emmanuel Kon, on this project. I wanted to try out next,
          and my friend was learning React, so this seemed like a good project to try next on.
        </p>
        <h4> Technology Journey </h4>
        <p>
          Because Emmanuel did not have a lot of opinions on which technologies he liked while I did,
          I decided to use NextJS for this project. The reason was, I could use next in combination with
          Redis to limit API calls to external API that we were using for the project. Doing the project
          was pretty smooth sailing as I was able to get some commits and he was able to get some in too.
          I was relegated to the backend work, where I set up the Caching using Upstash
          (Maybe I could have used Vercel's Caching?), and setting up the API Route that we would grab the
          information from (we only had access to one useful API route). I left Emmanuel to dealing with the
          frontend work because he was less experienced with it and I wanted him to learn a bit of frontend.
          We had some bugs here and there, where I fixed some and he fixed some, the most recent one I fixed
          which was a loading bug, which I lazily fixed by using Vercel's SWR. Sometimes Libraries are too sweet.
        </p>
        <h4> Reflections </h4>
        <p>
          I didn't really have a lot of React Experience, so it is very important to have
          despite the triviality of the project. Moreover, using Redis for limiting API calls
          was nice to because it caused me to learn a bit about the architecture of a website
          and how to make it more performant.

        <h2> Awakening Database </h2>
        <h3> Motivation </h3>
        <p>
          Before doing this project, I had been doing a fair bit of research into SQLite for Web
          Applications. While SQLite has clear limitations that the library's authors acknowledge,
          My projects scale to 0 users which makes SQLite the ideal solution for most of my web apps.
          However, this project serviced one of the other uses of SQLite, notably for creating a read
          heavy or single writer apps.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have talked a fair amount on the SQLite side, but what about this "Awakening"?
          The Awakening I am talking about is Fire Emblem Awakening. While Serenes Forest is
          a good source of Fire Emblem information, there isn't a way to programtically use this
          information, hence my project, I scrape the data from their page and store it onto a
          SQLite Database which allows the data to be used programatically.
        </p>
        <h3> Technology Journey </h3>
        <p>
          I don't like using external libraries in my projects, however, because I did need to
          web scrape I used the Beautiful Soup, Requests combo. Initially I wanted to do a CLI,
          but this did not make much sense for the application I was going for, so I decided to
          use a TUI. I went with Pytermgui, but the reactivity solution wasn't obvious so I decided
          not to use that. I ended up opening an http server and serving an HTML form and parsing the
          input from this form to control what gets scraped. Python has a built in HTTP server so this
          is enough for me.
        </p>
        <h3> Reflection </h3>
        <p>
          The HTTP Server Idea is definitely over engineered, and I do have more stuff that I could scrape off of the
          website,
          but for the limited domain I have its fine. I do like that with python I am able to
          leverage the standard library for a minimal dependency project because it makes it easier to install.
